Q.1
shutil.copy() will copy only a single file whereas shutil.copytree() will copy all the files and the fiolders in that folder

Q.2
shutil.move() can be used to rename the file by moving the file into the same directory but with a different name

Q.3
Deleting using send2trash module will send the files to the recycle bin but using the shutil delete command will permanently delete the files.

Q.4
I think zipfile.Zipfile() is similar to the open() function because the first part in the brackets has the file name and second part is for the read/write or append module.
